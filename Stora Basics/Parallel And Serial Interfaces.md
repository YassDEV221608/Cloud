# Storage Interface Types

## Parallel Interface

### Overview
* Data is transmitted across multiple wires simultaneously (like a multi-lane highway)
* Example: IDE/ATA uses 40 or 80 wires in the cable

### Limitations
* Signal timing issues (signals arrive at slightly different times)
* More susceptible to interference between wires
* Requires bulkier cables
* Limited cable length due to synchronization issues
* Higher cost due to more wires and complexity

## Serial Interface

### Overview
* Data is transmitted one bit at a time over a single pair of wires (like a single-lane highway with faster speed limit)
* Examples: SATA, SAS

### Advantages
* Simpler and thinner cables
* Can operate at much higher frequencies
* Better signal integrity over longer distances
* Lower cost due to simpler design
* Less electromagnetic interference
* More reliable data transmission
