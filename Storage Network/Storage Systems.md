# Storage Systems Types and Architecture Guide

## 1. Storage Systems Types

### DAS (Direct Attached Storage)
* Directly connected to single server
* Characteristics:
  * Simple architecture
  * Low cost
  * Limited scalability
  * No sharing between servers
* Connection types:
  * Internal: Inside server chassis
  * External: Connected via cables
* Common interfaces:
  * SATA
  * SAS
  * SCSI
  * USB

### SAN (Storage Area Network)
* High-speed dedicated storage network
* Components:
  * Storage Arrays
  * Fabric (switches/directors)
  * Host Bus Adapters (HBAs)
* Features:
  * High performance
  * Scalability
  * Shared access
  * Block-level access
* Protocols:
  * Fibre Channel (FC)
  * iSCSI
  * FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet)

## 2. Storage System Architecture

### Front-End
* Interface with hosts
* Components:
  * Front-end ports
  * Controllers
  * Host connectivity
* Protocols management
* Load balancing

### Cache
* High-speed memory layer
* Operations:
  * Read Cache:
    * Read Hit (data in cache)
    * Read Miss (data on disk)
  * Write Cache:
    * Write-through (simultaneous)
    * Write-back (cached first)
* Cache tiering for performance

### Back-End
* Disk connectivity
* Components:
  * Back-end controllers
  * Disk ports
  * Physical disk management
* RAID management

## 3. Storage Provisioning

### Thick Provisioning
* All space allocated upfront
* Guaranteed performance
* Less efficient space utilization
* No risk of oversubscription

### Thin Provisioning
* Space allocated on demand
* Better storage utilization
* Risks:
  * Oversubscription
  * Performance impact
* Requires monitoring

## 4. Storage Tiering

### Manual Tiering
* Administrator-defined movement
* Based on policies
* Less efficient
* Lower overhead

### Automatic Tiering
* AI/ML-based data movement
* Performance optimization
* Capacity optimization
* Types:
  * Hot data (SSD/NVMe)
  * Warm data (SAS)
  * Cold data (SATA)

## 5. JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks)
* No RAID protection
* Characteristics:
  * Simple configuration
  * Direct disk access
  * Good for big data
  * No redundancy
* Use cases:
  * Big data applications
  * Archive storage
  * Cost-effective storage

## 6. Advanced Features

### Data Services
* Snapshots
* Replication
* Deduplication
* Compression
* Encryption

### Performance Optimization
* Quality of Service (QoS)
* Multi-pathing
* Load balancing
* Cache optimization

### Management
* Centralized management
* Monitoring tools
* Reporting capabilities
* Automation options

## 7. Best Practices

### Design
* Match storage type to workload
* Plan for growth
* Consider performance requirements
* Include redundancy

### Implementation
* Follow vendor best practices
* Document configurations
* Test failover scenarios
* Implement monitoring

### Operation
* Regular maintenance
* Performance monitoring
* Capacity planning
* Security updates
